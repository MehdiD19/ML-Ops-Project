## 🎯 Project Overview

Welcome to your MLOps project! In this hands-on project, you'll build a complete machine learning system to predict the age of abalone (a type of sea snail) using physical measurements instead of the traditional time-consuming method of counting shell rings under a microscope.

**Your Mission**: Transform a simple ML model into a production-ready system with automated training, deployment, and prediction capabilities.

## 📊 About the Dataset

Traditionally, determining an abalone's age requires:
1. Cutting the shell through the cone
2. Staining it
3. Counting rings under a microscope (very time-consuming!)

**Your Goal**: Use easier-to-obtain physical measurements (shell weight, diameter, etc.) to predict the age automatically.

📥 **Download**: Get the dataset from the [Kaggle page](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rodolfomendes/abalone-dataset)


## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- GitHub account
- [Kaggle account](https://www.kaggle.com/account/login?phase=startRegisterTab&returnUrl=%2F) (for dataset download)
- Python 3.11

### Setup Steps

1. **Fork this repository**
   - ⚠️ **Important**: Uncheck "Copy the `main` branch only" to get all project branches

2. **Add your team members** as admins to your forked repository

3. **Clone your forked repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/ML-Ops-Project.git
   cd ML-Ops-Project
   ```

4. **Set up your development environment**:
   ```bash
   # Sync dependencies and create virtual environment
   uv sync

   # Activate the virtual environment
   source .venv/bin/activate  # macOS/Linux
   # OR on Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

   # Install pre-commit hooks for code quality
   uv run pre-commit install
   ```

5. **Verify your setup**:
   ```bash
   # Check Python version
   python --version  # Should be 3.11.x

   # Test pre-commit hooks
   uv run pre-commit run --all-files
   ```

## 📝 How to Work on This Project

### The Branch-by-Branch Approach

This project is organized into numbered branches, each representing a step in building your MLOps system. Think of it like a guided tutorial where each branch teaches you something new!

**Here's how it works**:

1. **Each branch = One pull request** with specific tasks
2. **Follow the numbers** (branch_0, branch_1, etc.) in order
3. **Read the PR instructions** (PR_0.md, PR_1.md, etc.) before starting
4. **Complete all TODOs** in that branch's code
5. **Create a pull request** when done
6. **Merge and move to the next branch**

### Step-by-Step Workflow

For each numbered branch:

```bash
# Switch to the branch
git checkout branch_number_i

# Get latest changes (except for branch_1)
git pull origin main
# Note: A VIM window might open - just type ":wq" to close it

# Push your branch
git push
```

Then:
1. 📖 Read the PR_i.md file carefully
2. 💻 Complete all the TODOs in the code
3. 🔧 Test your changes
4. 📤 Open **ONE** pull request to your main branch
5. ✅ Merge the pull request
6. 🔄 Move to the next branch

> **💡 Pro Tip**: Always integrate your previous work when starting a new branch (except branch_1)!

### 🔍 Understanding Pull Requests

Pull Requests (PRs) are how you propose and review changes before merging them into your main codebase. They're essential for team collaboration!

**Important**: When creating a PR, make sure you're merging into YOUR forked repository, not the original:

❌ **Wrong** (merging to original repo):
![PR Wrong](assets/PR_wrong.png)

✅ **Correct** (merging to your fork):
![PR Right](assets/PR_right.png)

## 💡 Development Tips

### Managing Dependencies

Use uv to manage dependencies. Install or update packages with:

```bash
uv add <package>==<version>
```

Then sync the environment and regenerate the dependency files:

```bash
uv sync
```

### Code Quality
- The pre-commit hooks will automatically format your code
- Remove all TODOs and unused code before final submission
- Use clear variable names and add docstrings

## 🛠️ Development Workflow

### Running Code Quality Checks

```bash
# Run linter
uv run ruff check .

# Run linter with auto-fix
uv run ruff check . --fix

# Run all pre-commit hooks
uv run pre-commit run --all-files
```

### Managing Dependencies

```bash
# Add a new package
uv add package-name==version

# Add a development package
uv add --dev package-name==version

# Sync environment after changes
uv sync

# Update lock file
uv lock
```

### Git Workflow for Each Branch

```bash
# 1. Switch to the branch
git checkout branch_name

# 2. Pull latest changes from main (except for branch_1)
git pull origin main

# 3. Create your working branch
git checkout -b branch_name-your-name

# 4. Make your changes, then commit
git add .
git commit -m "descriptive message"

# 5. Push your branch
git push -u origin branch_name-your-name

# 6. Create Pull Request on GitHub
# Merge to main after review
```

   ```bash
   # Your model files should be in src/web_service/local_objects/
   # - model.pkl (trained model)

   ```

2. **Start the API server**:
   ```bash
   # Activate your virtual environment
